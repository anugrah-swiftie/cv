    <!--the alt attribute is used in case when the browser is unable to render the image then it will display an alternative text to the user to decribe what the image was about. Google looks at it to find what our website is about. This picture is on leetcode so it is hosted on leetcode servers. So, the browser ping the leetcode servers to download the image and show it on our website.-->
    
    <!--Difference between <em> and <i>
        Both the elements italicize the words but the <em> element tells the browser that the words enclosed between it should be emphasized while the <i> element only italicize the text. It's good practice to always use <em> instead of <i> because it conveys more information and it isn't just about style. When we're writing HTML code, we're more concerned about structuring our text rather than caring about how it looks.
        Similarly whenever we want to make some text bold, we should use <strong> instead of <b> because it <strong> means the text between it is of strong importance.-->
